# Product Requirements Document: ai-dev-tasks MCP

## Introduction/Overview

The ai-dev-tasks MCP is a simple, single-purpose MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that serves as a template/starter for MCP development, a string processing utility, and a learning/demo MCP for testing purposes. The tool reads the content of `instructions/create-prd.md`, appends a provided string to that content, and returns the combined result to the agent.

This MCP addresses the need for a simple, offline-capable tool that demonstrates basic MCP functionality without external dependencies or network connections.

## Goals

1. Create a functional npx-accessible MCP tool that can be easily installed and used
2. Implement a single tool that processes strings by combining file content with user input
3. Provide a template/starter for MCP development that demonstrates best practices
4. Ensure the tool works completely offline with no external network dependencies
5. Return properly formatted MCP responses to the agent

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to create a simple MCP tool so that I can learn MCP development patterns and best practices.

2. **As an AI agent**, I want to send a string to the MCP tool so that it gets appended to the create-prd.md content and returned to me.

3. **As a developer**, I want to install the MCP tool via npx so that I can quickly access it without manual installation steps.

4. **As a developer**, I want the MCP to work offline so that I can use it in environments without internet connectivity.

## Functional Requirements

1. The MCP must be accessible via npx command-line interface
2. The MCP must implement a single tool that accepts a string parameter
3. The MCP must read the content of `instructions/create-prd.md` file
4. The MCP must append the provided string parameter to the file content
5. The MCP must return the combined content as a properly formatted MCP response
6. The MCP must handle file reading errors and return standard MCP error responses
7. The MCP must not make any external network connections or API calls
8. The MCP must be self-contained with no external dependencies beyond Node.js standard library

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Multiple tools or complex functionality
- External API integrations or network requests
- File writing or modification capabilities
- Complex string processing or transformation
- User authentication or authorization
- Persistent storage or caching
- Real-time updates or event handling
- Complex error recovery or retry mechanisms

## Design Considerations

- The MCP should follow standard MCP protocol specifications
- The tool should have a clear, descriptive name that indicates its purpose
- Error messages should be user-friendly and informative
- The response format should be consistent with MCP standards
- The tool should be lightweight and fast to execute

## Technical Considerations

- Must be compatible with Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
- Should use standard Node.js file system APIs for file reading
- Must implement proper MCP protocol message handling
- Should include proper package.json configuration for npx distribution
- Must handle file path resolution relative to the MCP tool's location
- Should include basic input validation for the string parameter

## Success Metrics

- The MCP tool can be successfully installed and executed via npx
- The tool correctly reads the create-prd.md file and appends the provided string
- The tool returns properly formatted MCP responses to the agent
- The tool handles error conditions gracefully with standard MCP error responses
- The tool operates completely offline without external dependencies
- The tool can be used as a reference implementation for other MCP developers

## Open Questions

1. What should be the exact name of the single tool within the MCP?
2. Should the tool validate the input string format or length?
3. What should happen if the create-prd.md file doesn't exist?
4. Should the tool support different file encodings or assume UTF-8?
5. What should be the minimum Node.js version requirement?
6. Should the tool include any logging or debugging capabilities?
